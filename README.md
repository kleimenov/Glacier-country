### Tech descripton and specification

Tech descripton and specification

This website includes three web pages. All pages are responsive, work with a broad variety of screens in range from mobile devices (screen width 320px)
to desktops (screen width 1200px and higher). This cross-devices website affords users to feel comfortable interacting with content whether the size of the screen their device has.

This project is build with the following technologies:

- HTML;
- CSS;
- JavaScript;
- SASS;
- weather API (fetch data from weather API);

Semantic HTML is used for all webpages markup with the elements of block - element - modifier system in class naming. 
All elements are styled with CSS using the inheritance and cascading rules, and selectors specificity. 
CSS rules are contained in a separate .scss files for easier maitenance and then compiled with the Sass preprocessor into a CSS style master file 
to reduce the number of interactions with a server. Responsiveness is provided by the usage of media queries and sass variables. 
All algorithms were implemented with JavaScript. This includes DOM manipulation (DOM elements creation and modification) and API fetching.
